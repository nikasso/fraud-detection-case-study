# Fraud Detection

This was a two-day case-study with the goal of creating an end-to-end data pipeline for a new e-commerce website to weed out fraudsters.

Predicted whether an event from an e-commerce site was fraudulent, based on 50+ features per event. Used logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest classifier models to improve prediction recall and precision. Created Flask app to process incoming event data and make live predictions.
