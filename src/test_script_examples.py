Production companies and distributors often know all the tricks of the trade, while writers and filmmakers know little about how to protect themselves. This seminar, geared towards both artists and attorneys representing artists, explains how writers and filmmakers can prevent problems from arising by properly securing underlying rights, and by encouraging the other party to live up to agreements by adding performance milestones, default penalties and arbitration clauses. In the event of a dispute, participants learn what remedies are available to enforce their rights. Related topics include creative approvals, typical compensation and terms of studio contracts, merchandising deals, and negotiating tactics and strategies. The seminar includes more than 100 pages of useful contracts, checklists, forms and materials.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Mark Litwak<\/strong> is an entertainment attorney based in Beverly Hills, California.
